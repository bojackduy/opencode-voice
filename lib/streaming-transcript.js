// Streaming-transcript stability logic (STAGE 1, local streaming dictation).
//
// Rolling-window STT re-transcribes overlapping audio on every tick, so each
// hypothesis restates words the previous one already contained. Blindly
// appending every hypothesis would duplicate words; blindly replacing would
// flicker committed text. This module splits each hypothesis into:
//
//   stable   - prefix confirmed by successive hypotheses; monotonic, never
//              rewritten once emitted (callers can render/commit it).
//   tentative - unconfirmed tail; replaced wholesale on every update.
//
// Alignment scheme (bounded-utterance overlap join, NOT time-anchored):
//
// whisper-server `/inference` with `response_format=json` returns
// `{ "text": "..." }` - text only, no audio timestamps. `verbose_json`
// returns `{ text, segments: [{ start, end, text, ... }], ... }` where
// segment `start`/`end` are seconds RELATIVE TO THE SUBMITTED SNAPSHOT (each
// rolling window restarts at 0; verified against a live local whisper-server,
// see `.opencode/loopd/goals/17bca58e-.../whisper-verbose-fixture.json`).
// Consecutive snapshots therefore cannot share an absolute clock, and
// whisper's word timestamps jitter at window edges, so segments are never
// used as cross-window commit pointers. Instead each new hypothesis is joined
// onto the assembled transcript by maximal word suffix-prefix overlap:
//
//   assembled = stable + tentative (previous)
//   k = longest suffix of assembled that equals a prefix of the hypothesis
//   novel = hypothesis after that overlap; assembled' = assembled + novel
//
// The whole previously assembled transcript becomes stable once any overlap
// re-observes it (every old word was just heard again); only the novel tail
// stays tentative. When the window rolls forward the hypothesis no longer
// contains the historical prefix, and the overlap anchors on the shared
// middle - no duplication, no loss.
//
// Revision policy: when the hypothesis shares a longer prefix with the
// assembled transcript FROM THE START than the suffix overlap (whisper
// restated the same region with different words), it is a self-correction,
// not new speech. Corrections inside the tentative region replace the tail;
// corrections touching committed (stable) words FREEZE stable - stable is
// never rewritten - and the tail shows the hypothesis minus whatever stable
// prefix it still shares, so no word is ever emitted twice.
//
// Update rule summary:
//   1. Empty hypothesis: keep stable, clear the tail (pause/silence).
//   2. c = common word-prefix(assembled, hypothesis), k = overlap(assembled,
//      hypothesis). If c > k: revision path (see above).
//   3. Else: assembled' = assembled + hypothesis[k:]; stable = assembled
//      (when k > 0, or when assembled was empty nothing is stable yet);
//      tentative = hypothesis[k:]. With no overlap at all (k = 0, c = 0)
//      the hypothesis is genuinely new speech after a gap: appended whole.
//   4. The first hypothesis only fills tentative (nothing is confirmed by a
//      single observation).
//
// Comparison is word level, punctuation/case-insensitive; original words are
// preserved for display. Pure punctuation tokens must match exactly to count.
//
// Memory: O(transcript words). The tracker holds stable words, the tentative
// tail, and the last window hints - no history list, no per-tick
// accumulation. Long dictations grow only the transcript itself (the output).
